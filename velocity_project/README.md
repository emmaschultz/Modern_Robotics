# Assignment 1

Basic example of a controller, commander, and simulator. The commander creates a sin wave with a given amplitude and frequency. The value of the sin graph at a point in time is used as the velocity command for the controller. The controller changes the velocity depending on the velocity command that is received from the commander.
