# URDF Design Project
This package creates a model robot with two degrees of freedom. The robot has two joints and three links. The robot is run in gazebo and rviz. The robot is being commanded to oscillate its two movable joints a sinusoidal motion.


## Example usage
In order to run this code, first open a terminal and start the roscore. In a second terminal, type "roslaunch urdf_design_project urdf_design_project.launch". This will start rviz, gazebo, and any nodes that need to be running in order to the code to execute.
